## **Date**
-	Week 24 (17th February – 23rd February)

## **Tasks**
-	Conversed with Brian and will now build a NodeJS webapp to offer the client controls of the JetBot
- Add to portfolio.py script, with the view to make the script callable from the NodeJS app with arguments of the stock symbols, i.e INTC

## **Reflection**
-	Researched NodeJS and discovered the exec() function to call local scripts from within NodeJS webserver.
- Added argparse ability to portfolio.py to enable interaction between NodeJS client and Jetson Nano.

### **Software:**
- utilised a different function from within API documentation from alphavantage.co
