# AI Companion
Module: Software Engineering &amp; Test

## Overview
The AI Companion Robot is a home-assistant robot that can move across floors, carpets and mild terrain. Equipped with an HD video camera, the AI Companion Robot will be able to recognise faces, pets, rooms and objects. The AI Companion Robot will intelligently operate around the house by avoiding objects and monitoring who’s in the house (via face recognition) and what room they’re in (via room recognition), This robot can serve as your eyes and ears when you’re away from home.

## Goals for December Demonstration
#### Obstacle Avoidance 
Train a machine learning model to recognise when it is blocked or free to move forward, while operating around the house (or just in a single room to begin with).

#### Object Detection 
Detect objects(including people) and follow them.

#### Facial Recognition 
Recognise faces, store them in a local database and compare all new faces to the old faces in the database.
