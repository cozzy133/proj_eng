## **Date**
-	Week 22 (3rd February – 9th February)

## **Tasks**
-	Research more financial information regarding stocks
- research digital wellbeing data collection 
- research google fit data collection and possible uses for ML

## **Reflection**
-	Found lots of information regarding training a deep learning model to utilise NLP on news articles, with the view of training a ML model capable of predicting a positive, negative or neutral future outcome of a stock.
- need to do more digital wellbeing research as there's not much information online about it.
- Google Fit data is readily available to download. I now need to decide what ML model is best suited to provide valuable information to the user.
